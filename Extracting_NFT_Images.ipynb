It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`.

            "* **The Penguin:** The penguin is predominantly white with dark purplish-maroon wings and a round, orange beak. Its cheeks are rosy, and it has small, happy, closed eyes, suggesting a friendly and content expression. The penguin's feet are orange.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Clothing:** It's wearing a light gray knitted beanie hat with a dark gray pom-pom on top. Around its midsection is a brown tool belt with three screwdrivers (orange, teal, and a smaller one) and a small monkey wrench.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Pose:** The penguin appears to be standing with its wings slightly raised, as if ready for action or in a welcoming posture.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Background:** The background is a solid, light sky-blue color, providing a simple and clean backdrop that focuses attention on the penguin.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Style:** The illustration style is simple, clean lines and flat coloring. It has a cute, childlike aesthetic. The overall feel is whimsical and positive.\n",
            "\n",
            "The image's composition is centered, with plenty of negative space around the penguin, creating a calm and uncluttered visual effect. The color palette is soft and pleasant.\n",
